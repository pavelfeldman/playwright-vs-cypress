A form component with basic validation.

**Note:** we are using [tailwindcss media queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color/#responsive) to change the background color of the `<sectiofbackgrounds based on viewport size, something we can declare in our tests with playwright.

### [Work around the Playwright MacOS permission issue](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4752#issuecomment-524086077)

This will prevent the dialog "*Do you want the application “Chromium.app” to accept incoming network connection?*"

Alternatively you can turn off the firewall.

## [Playwright](#Playwright)

The tests are under `./playwright`.

In a new tab inside your terminal, run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm run playwright
```


There are two ways to view the UI while executing Playwright tests:

1. To execute tests with debugger, use [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector/).

    ```bash
    PWDEBUG=1 npm run playwright
    ```

2. Add `{ headless: false }` to [chromium launch function](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#run-in-headed-mode) in the spec file.

## [Cypress](#Cypress)

The tests are under `./cypress/integration`.

To start the test runner:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

To run headlessly:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
